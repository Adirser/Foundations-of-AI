## Introduction

The purpose of these projects is to delve into the building blocks of Artificial Intelligence. Each project focuses on implementing and understanding a fundamental AI concept or algorithm. These projects were part of my journey in the "Foundations of Artificial Intelligence" course and I'm excited to share them here.

## Projects

Here are some of the main projects you'll find in this repository:

1. **A* Search Algorithm**: A pathfinding algorithm widely used in AI.
2. **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function.
3. **Genetic Search Algorithm**: An optimization or search technique inspired by the process of natural selection.
4. **ID3 Decision Tree**: A machine learning algorithm for decision making, implemented from scratch.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/[repo_name].git


Navigate to the project of your choice and follow the instructions in the respective README files.
